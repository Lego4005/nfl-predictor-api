## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Initialize services
neo4j_service = Neo4jKnowledgeService()
await neo4j_service.initialize()

# Ingest game data
ingestion_pipeline = Neo4jIngestionPipeline(neo4j_service)
await ingestion_pipeline.ingest_game_data(game, predictions)

# Build relationship networks
team_network = TeamRelationshipNetwork(neo4j_service)
await team_network.build_all_team_relationships()

# Retrieve enhanced memories
memory_retrieval = GraphEnhancedMemoryRetrieval(neo4j_service)
memories = await memory_retrieval.comprehensive_memory_retrieval(
    expert_id, context, max_results=10
)
```

### Training Loop Integration
```python
# Training loop automatically uses Neo4j
