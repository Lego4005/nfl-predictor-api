## Integration Tasks

### TASK 1: Integrate Real LLM Calls into Existing Prediction Generator
**File:** `src/training/prediction_generator.py`
**Goal:** Replace hardcoded expert logic with real OpenRouter LLM calls

**Changes Needed:**
1. Add OpenRouter API integration
2. Replace `_generate_single_prediction()` hardcoded logic with LLM calls
3. Use expert configurations as system prompts
4. Keep existing interfaces and structure
5. Add rate limiting and error handling

**Implementation:**
```python
# Add to PredictionGenerator.__init__()
self.openrouter_api_key = os.getenv('OPENROUTER_API_KEY')
self.openrouter_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
self.model = "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free"

# Replace _generate_single_prediction() with LLM call
async def _generate_single_prediction_llm(self, expert_type, prediction_type, game_context, memory_result, config):
    # Build expert system prompt from config
    # Make OpenRouter API call
    # Parse response into GamePrediction
```

### TASK 2: Integrate Learning Memory System into Training Loop
**File:** `src/training/training_loop_orchestrator.py`
**Goal:** Add post-game learning and memory formation

**Changes Needed:**
1. Add ExpertLearningMemorySystem as component
2. Add post-game learning step in `process_single_game()`
3. Store and retrieve learned memories
4. Track expert belief evolution

**Implementation:**
```python
# Add to TrainingLoopOrchestrator.__init__()
from training.expert_learning_memory_system import ExpertLearningMemorySystem
self.learning_memory_system = ExpertLearningMemorySystem(self.config_manager)

# Add to process_single_game() after outcome processing
if game.home_score is not None and game.away_score is not None:
    for expert_id, prediction in expert_predictions.items():
        reflection = await self.learning_memory_system.process_post_game_learning(
            expert_id, game_context, prediction, actual_outcome
        )
```

### TASK 3: Add Monitoring Checkpoints
**File:** `src/training/training_loop_orchestrator.py`
**Goal:** Monitor for specific issues during processing

**Monitoring Points:**
- **Game 20:** Check memory storage is working
- **Game 50:** Check expert state evolution
- **Game 100:** Check memory retrieval relevance
- **Game 200:** Check reasoning chain evolution

**Implementation:**
```python
async def _check_system_health(self, game_number: int):
    if game_number == 20:
        await self._check_memory_storage()
    elif game_number == 50:
        await self._check_expert_state_evolution()
    elif game_number == 100:
        await self._check_memory_retrieval_relevance()
    elif game_number == 200:
        await self._check_reasoning_evolution()
```

### TASK 4: Update Memory Retrieval Integration
**File:** `src/training/memory_retrieval_system.py`
**Goal:** Integrate learned memories with existing memory system

**Changes Needed:**
1. Connect to ExpertLearningMemorySystem storage
2. Include team-specific and matchup-specific memories
3. Apply temporal decay to learned memories
4. Maintain existing similarity scoring
