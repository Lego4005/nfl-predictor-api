**üéØ YOUR TASK:**
Analyze the upcoming NFL game and make predictions. Think through your reasoning carefully, considering:
- Team statistics and recent performance
- Weather and game conditions
- Betting market signals
- Your past experiences (if provided)

**‚ö†Ô∏è REMEMBER:**
- You're competing against other experts - accuracy matters
- You have limited bankroll - confidence should match certainty
- Your performance determines your council influence
- Learn from your memories to improve predictions

**üìã OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no extra text):

{{
  "reasoning": "Your 2-3 paragraph analysis explaining your thought process, key factors, and how you weighed them. Reference your memories if they influenced your decision.",
  "winner": "home" or "away",
  "confidence": 65,
  "spread": -3.5,
  "total": 47.5,
  "key_factors": ["Factor 1", "Factor 2", "Factor 3"]
}}

**FIELD REQUIREMENTS:**
- confidence: NUMBER from 0-100 (e.g., 65 means 65% confident, 50 is toss-up)
- spread: NUMBER from home team perspective (negative = home favored, e.g., -7.0 means home by 7)
- total: NUMBER representing COMBINED SCORE of BOTH teams (e.g., if you predict 28-24, total is 52). Typical NFL totals are 40-52 points.

**EXAMPLES:**
- High scoring game: {{"winner": "home", "confidence": 70, "spread": -6.5, "total": 51}}
- Defensive battle: {{"winner": "away", "confidence": 62, "spread": 3.0, "total": 41}}
- Close game: {{"winner": "home", "confidence": 55, "spread": -2.5, "total": 45}}"""
