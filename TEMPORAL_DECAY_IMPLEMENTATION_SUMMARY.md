# Temporal Decay System - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

A sophisticated temporal decay system that ensures each expert weights historical memories according to the stability of the factors they analyze. This creates personality-driven memory prioritization that matches each expert's analytical approach.

## Key Results from Testing

### Memory Decay Comparison (80% Similarity Memory)

| Expert | 7 days | 30 days | 90 days | 180 days | 365 days | 730 days |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Momentum Tracker** | 0.829 | 0.749 | 0.635 | 0.579 | 0.561 | 0.560 |
| **Market Reader** | 0.844 | 0.798 | 0.710 | 0.635 | 0.578 | 0.561 |
| **Aggressive Gambler** | 0.848 | 0.812 | 0.738 | 0.666 | 0.596 | 0.564 |
| **Conservative Analyzer** | 0.857 | 0.846 | 0.821 | 0.787 | 0.731 | 0.657 |
| **Weather Specialist** | 0.858 | 0.852 | 0.835 | 0.813 | 0.772 | 0.710 |

### Key Insights

1. **Momentum Tracker** (45-day half-life): A 6-month-old memory is nearly worthless (0.560 score)
2. **Weather Specialist** (730-day half-life): A 2-year-old memory still retains significant value (0.710 score)
3. **Conservative Analyzer** maintains strong historical memory while **Momentum Tracker** focuses intensely on recent performance

## Memory Ranking Demonstration

**Same 4 memories ranked by different experts:**

### Conservative Analyzer (Values Historical Patterns)
1. **Very similar recent game** (30d old, 90% similarity) → Score: 0.916
2. **Nearly identical game from last season** (365d old, 95% similarity) → Score: 0.836
3. **Similar game from mid-season** (180d old, 85% similarity) → Score: 0.822
4. **Somewhat similar very recent game** (7d old, 70% similarity) → Score: 0.787

### Momentum Tracker (Values Recent Performance)
1. **Very similar recent game** (30d old, 90% similarity) → Score: 0.819
2. **Somewhat similar very recent game** (7d old, 70% similarity) → Score: 0.759
3. **Nearly identical game from last season** (365d old, 95% similarity) → Score: 0.666
4. **Similar game from mid-season** (180d old, 85% similarity) → Score: 0.614

**Key Difference**: Conservative Analyzer prioritizes the highly similar year-old game (#2), while Momentum Tracker ranks it #3 because age matters more than similarity for momentum analysis.

## Category-Specific Decay

**Weather Specialist analyzing 90-day-old memories:**
- **Weather impact patterns** (900-day half-life): 0.840 score - "How 20mph winds affect passing"
- **Stadium conditions** (730-day half-life): 0.835 score - "Soldier Field wind patterns"
- **Team adaptation** (365-day half-life): 0.813 score - "How Bears perform in cold"

Even within the same expert, different memory types decay at different rates based on their stability.

## Learning Rate Adjustment

**How quickly experts update beliefs based on outcome age:**

| Expert | 1 day | 7 days | 30 days | 90 days | 180 days |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Momentum Tracker** | 0.098 | 0.090 | 0.063 | 0.025 | 0.006 |
| **Market Reader** | 0.099 | 0.095 | 0.079 | 0.050 | 0.025 |
| **Conservative Analyzer** | 0.100 | 0.099 | 0.095 | 0.087 | 0.076 |
| **Weather Specialist** | 0.100 | 0.099 | 0.097 | 0.092 | 0.084 |

**Momentum Tracker** stops learning from 6-month-old outcomes (0.006 rate), while **Weather Specialist** still learns significantly (0.084 rate) because weather patterns remain relevant.

## Expert Decay Spectrum

### Extremely Fast Decay (45 days)
- **Momentum Tracker**: Momentum is inherently short-term

### Very Fast Decay (90 days)
- **Market Reader**: Markets evolve rapidly

### Fast Decay (120 days)
- **Aggressive Gambler**: Opportunities emerge and disappear quickly

### Moderate Decay (180-210 days)
- **Injury Tracker**: Rosters change but position importance stable
- **Situational Expert**: Motivation patterns moderately stable

### Slow Decay (365-450 days)
- **Statistical Purist**: Mathematical relationships persist
- **Conservative Analyzer**: Proven patterns change gradually

### Extremely Slow Decay (730 days)
- **Weather Specialist**: Physics doesn't change

## Technical Implementation

### Core Formula
```
final_score = (0.70 × similarity_score) + (0.30 × temporal_decay_score)
temporal_decay_score = 0.5^(days_old / expert_half_life)
```

### Learning Rate Adjustment
```
adjusted_learning_rate = base_learning_rate × 0.5^(days_since_outcome / expert_half_life)
```

### Category-Specific Half-Lives
Each expert has different decay rates for different memory categories:
- **Weather Specialist**: Weather patterns (900d) vs Team adaptation (365d)
- **Market Reader**: Line movement (60d) vs Public tendencies (120d)
- **Conservative Analyzer**: Team quality (540d) vs Coaching (270d)

## Impact on Expert Behavior

### Before Temporal Decay
- All experts weighted memories equally regardless of age
- Recent market shifts treated same as 2-year-old patterns
- Momentum expert confused by ancient streaks

### After Temporal Decay
- **Momentum Tracker** focuses laser-sharp on last 6 weeks
- **Weather Specialist** leverages deep historical weather data
- **Market Reader** adapts quickly to evolving betting patterns
- **Conservative Analyzer** builds confidence through accumulated evidence

## System Benefits

1. **Personality Alignment**: Each expert's memory system matches their analytical philosophy
2. **Adaptive Learning**: Recent outcomes influence fast-decay experts more than slow-decay experts
3. **Pattern Stability**: Stable patterns (weather) retain value longer than volatile patterns (momentum)
4. **Belief Revision**: Learning rates automatically adjust based on outcome relevance
5. **Memory Efficiency**: Old irrelevant memories naturally fade without manual cleanup

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Half-Life Optimization**: AI Orchestrator can tune half-lives based on performance
2. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Decay rates could vary by NFL season phase
3. **Cross-Expert Learning**: Fast-decay experts could learn from slow-decay expert insights
4. **Memory Compression**: Very old memories could be compressed into general principles

This temporal decay system ensures that each expert's memory aligns perfectly with the time scales of the factors they analyze, creating more accurate and personality-consistent predictions.
