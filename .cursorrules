## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The NFL prediction system implements an innovative multi-expert prediction platform with sophisticated domain-specific logic:

## Core Prediction Engine
Importance Score: 95/100

The system's foundation is a 15-expert prediction ensemble:
- Each expert has unique personality traits affecting predictions
- Expert specializations range from weather analysis to momentum tracking
- Weighted voting mechanism for prediction consensus building
- Memory-enhanced prediction with episodic learning
- Multi-category analysis covering game outcomes, player stats, and betting markets

## Temporal Memory System
Importance Score: 90/100

Expert-specific memory management with decay formulas:
```
influence_score = (0.70 × similarity) + (0.30 × 0.5^(days/half_life))
```

Memory categories with specialized half-lives:
- Weather patterns: 900 days
- Market movements: 60 days
- Coaching patterns: 240 days
- Team momentum: 30 days
- Venue effects: 730 days

## Prediction Categories
Importance Score: 85/100

Comprehensive 27-category prediction framework:
- Game outcomes and scoring
- Player performance metrics
- Weather impact analysis
- Betting market indicators
- Live game scenarios

## Expert Council System
Importance Score: 80/100

Dynamic expert selection using weighted criteria:
- Accuracy (35%)
- Recent Performance (25%)
- Consistency (20%)
- Calibration (10%)
- Specialization (10%)

## Learning Framework
Importance Score: 75/100

Multi-phase learning implementation:
- Episodic memory formation
- Belief revision based on outcomes
- Confidence calibration
- Pattern recognition
- Performance trend analysis

The system uniquely combines personality-driven experts, temporal memory decay, and comprehensive NFL analysis to create a sophisticated prediction platform focused on accuracy and continuous learning.
