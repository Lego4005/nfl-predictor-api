Demo 2020 Season Processing

Demonstrates the actual processing flow:
1. For each game, each expert generates predictions
2. Stores per-team thoughts and team vs team analysis
3. Makes predictions and stores them
4. Compares predictions to actual outcomes
5. Creates learning memories from the experience
