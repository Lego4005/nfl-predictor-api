# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NFL Predictor platform currently operates with mock data and needs to be enhanced with live data integration from multiple sports APIs. This feature will transform the platform from a prototype into a production-ready TypeScript system that provides real-time NFL predictions, prop bets, and fantasy insights using live data from The Odds API and SportsDataIO, with alternative data sources as backup options. The system will provide clear user notifications when APIs are unavailable rather than falling back to mock data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sports bettor, I want to see live NFL game predictions with current betting lines, so that I can make informed wagering decisions based on real-time market data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects any NFL week (1-18) THEN the system SHALL fetch live game data from The Odds API
2. WHEN live data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL display straight-up winners, ATS picks with current spreads, and totals with over/under lines
3. WHEN The Odds API is unavailable or returns errors THEN the system SHALL display a clear notification to users about API unavailability
4. WHEN displaying predictions THEN the system SHALL show confidence percentages for each pick
5. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement caching to reduce API calls while maintaining data freshness

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a fantasy football player, I want to see live player prop bets with current lines and predictions, so that I can identify profitable betting opportunities and optimize my fantasy lineups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the prop bets tab THEN the system SHALL display live prop bet data from SportsDataIO
2. WHEN prop data is available THEN the system SHALL show player name, market type, pick (Over/Under), current line, confidence percentage, bookmaker source, and game matchup
3. WHEN prop bet markets include THEN the system SHALL support Passing Yards, Rushing Yards, Receiving Yards, Touchdowns, Receptions, and Fantasy Points
4. WHEN SportsDataIO API fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear notification to users about prop data unavailability
5. WHEN displaying props THEN the system SHALL show at least 5 prop bets per week with the highest confidence scores

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DFS player, I want to see optimized fantasy picks with live salary data, so that I can build competitive lineups within salary cap constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views fantasy picks THEN the system SHALL fetch live DFS salary data from available sources
2. WHEN salary data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL calculate value scores (projected points per dollar) for all players
3. WHEN displaying fantasy picks THEN the system SHALL show the top 5 value picks with player name, position, salary, projected points, and value score
4. WHEN generating classic lineup THEN the system SHALL create an optimal DFS roster within standard salary cap constraints
5. WHEN DFS data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a clear notification to users about fantasy data unavailability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the platform, I want all prediction data to be exportable in multiple formats, so that I can analyze the data in external tools or share insights with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks download buttons THEN the system SHALL generate exports in JSON, CSV, and PDF formats
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include all live data fields with proper formatting and structure
3. WHEN live data is being used THEN the export SHALL include data source attribution and timestamp information
4. WHEN exports are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent data structure regardless of whether live or mock data is used
5. IF export generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and user notifications, so that users are clearly informed when external APIs experience issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any external API returns 4xx or 5xx errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a clear notification to users
2. WHEN API responses return zero rows or malformed data THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and notify users of data unavailability
3. WHEN multiple API failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic and show retry status to users
4. WHEN APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative data sources (ESPN API, NFL.com API, or RapidAPI sports endpoints)
5. WHEN APIs recover THEN the system SHALL automatically resume using live data and notify users of restored functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want fast and responsive data loading, so that I can quickly access predictions without waiting for slow API responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests data THEN the system SHALL implement caching to reduce redundant API calls
2. WHEN cached data exists and is fresh (less than 30 minutes old) THEN the system SHALL serve cached data instead of making new API calls
3. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators and estimated completion times
4. WHEN API responses are slow (>5 seconds) THEN the system SHALL timeout and fallback to cached or mock data
5. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL store both live and mock data with appropriate expiration timestamps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code to be properly typed and maintainable, so that the system is robust and easy to extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new files THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript with proper type definitions
2. WHEN implementing components THEN each file SHALL be kept under 400 lines of code for maintainability
3. WHEN types are complex THEN the system SHALL break them into separate type definition files
4. WHEN API responses are processed THEN the system SHALL validate data against TypeScript interfaces
5. WHEN refactoring is needed THEN the system SHALL split large files into smaller, focused modules
