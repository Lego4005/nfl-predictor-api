# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NFL Predictor platform currently uses mock prediction data and needs a sophisticated machine learning engine to generate accurate predictions for NFL games, player props, and fantasy football. This feature will transform the platform into a true AI-powered prediction system that analyzes historical data, team statistics, player performance, weather conditions, and betting market trends to generate confident predictions with explainable reasoning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sports bettor, I want AI-generated game predictions with confidence scores based on real statistical analysis, so that I can make informed betting decisions with transparent reasoning behind each pick.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ML engine analyzes a game THEN it SHALL consider team offensive/defensive rankings, recent form, head-to-head history, and injury reports
2. WHEN generating straight-up picks THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores between 50-95% based on statistical model certainty
3. WHEN calculating ATS predictions THEN the system SHALL analyze historical spread performance, public betting percentages, and line movement
4. WHEN predicting totals THEN the system SHALL consider pace of play, weather conditions, offensive/defensive efficiency, and recent scoring trends
5. WHEN displaying predictions THEN the system SHALL provide brief explanations for high-confidence picks (>70%)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a prop bettor, I want ML-generated player prop predictions that analyze individual player performance trends, so that I can identify profitable betting opportunities with statistical backing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing player props THEN the system SHALL consider player's last 5 games, season averages, matchup history, and target share trends
2. WHEN predicting passing yards THEN the system SHALL analyze opponent pass defense ranking, weather conditions, and quarterback recent form
3. WHEN predicting rushing/receiving yards THEN the system SHALL consider opponent run defense, player usage trends, and game script predictions
4. WHEN generating prop confidence THEN the system SHALL use ensemble models combining multiple statistical approaches
5. WHEN displaying top props THEN the system SHALL rank by edge over betting line, not just confidence percentage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a fantasy football player, I want AI-optimized lineup recommendations that consider salary constraints and correlation, so that I can build competitive DFS lineups with mathematical backing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing lineups THEN the system SHALL use linear programming to maximize projected points within salary constraints
2. WHEN calculating player projections THEN the system SHALL consider matchup difficulty, recent target share, and game environment factors
3. WHEN building lineups THEN the system SHALL account for player correlations (QB-WR stacks, game stacks, contrarian plays)
4. WHEN showing value picks THEN the system SHALL highlight players with highest projected points per dollar ratio
5. WHEN generating multiple lineups THEN the system SHALL provide diverse lineup construction strategies (cash vs GPP optimized)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want access to the ML model's feature importance and prediction explanations, so that I can understand and validate the reasoning behind predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL store feature importance scores for each model decision
2. WHEN displaying high-confidence picks THEN the system SHALL show top 3 contributing factors (e.g., "Home field advantage", "Defensive matchup", "Recent form")
3. WHEN model accuracy changes THEN the system SHALL track and display rolling accuracy metrics for different prediction types
4. WHEN predictions are wrong THEN the system SHALL log prediction vs actual results for model improvement
5. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints for model performance metrics and feature analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want automated model training and performance monitoring, so that the prediction accuracy improves over time without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new game results are available THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain models with updated data
2. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest retraining schedules
3. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL use cross-validation and hold-out testing to prevent overfitting
4. WHEN deploying model updates THEN the system SHALL use A/B testing to compare new vs existing model performance
5. WHEN storing predictions THEN the system SHALL maintain prediction history for accuracy tracking and model evaluation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast prediction generation that doesn't slow down the user experience, so that I can get real-time insights without waiting for complex calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating weekly predictions THEN the system SHALL complete all calculations within 30 seconds
2. WHEN serving predictions THEN the system SHALL cache results and serve from cache when data hasn't changed
3. WHEN models are training THEN the system SHALL continue serving predictions from the previous model version
4. WHEN prediction requests spike THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without performance degradation
5. WHEN integrating with live APIs THEN the system SHALL process new data and update predictions within 5 minutes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular ML architecture that supports multiple algorithms and easy experimentation, so that we can continuously improve prediction accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing models THEN the system SHALL support multiple algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks, Ensemble methods)
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL have a standardized feature engineering pipeline
3. WHEN experimenting THEN the system SHALL support easy model comparison and hyperparameter tuning
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use containerized models for consistent environments
5. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support distributed training and prediction serving
