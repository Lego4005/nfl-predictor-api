## Introduction
The NFL Predictor API is designed to deliver accurate football predictions with high performance and reliability. This document details the performance tuning configurations that enable the system to maintain sub-second response times under varying load conditions. The configuration framework spans three critical areas: database optimization, Redis caching, and production environment settings. These configurations work in concert to ensure efficient data access, optimal resource utilization, and consistent performance delivery. The system leverages Supabase as its primary database with comprehensive optimization strategies, Redis for high-speed caching with sophisticated eviction policies, and carefully tuned production settings that govern request handling, worker concurrency, and memory management.

## Database Optimization Settings

The database optimization configuration in `database_optimization.py` implements a comprehensive strategy for PostgreSQL performance tuning, specifically tailored for the Supabase environment. The configuration centers around connection pool sizing, query timeout thresholds, and indexing strategies that collectively ensure efficient database operations.

Connection pool sizing is managed through the `DatabaseOptimizationConfig` class, which defines `min_pool_size` and `max_pool_size` parameters. In production, these are configured via environment variables `DB_MIN_POOL_SIZE` and `DB_MAX_POOL_SIZE`, with defaults of 10 and 50 connections respectively. This range allows the system to handle varying loads efficiently, maintaining a minimum of 10 connections to avoid the overhead of constant connection creation while scaling up to 50 connections during peak traffic periods. The `max_queries` parameter limits the number of queries per connection to 100,000, preventing connection exhaustion, while `max_inactive_connection_lifetime` is set to 600 seconds to recycle idle connections.

Query timeout thresholds are enforced at multiple levels. The `query_timeout` parameter is set to 60 seconds in production, serving as a command timeout for all database operations. Additionally, individual connections are configured with a `statement_timeout` of 30 seconds, a `lock_timeout` of 10 seconds, and an `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` of 60 seconds. These granular timeouts prevent long-running queries from consuming resources and ensure that database locks are released promptly, maintaining system responsiveness.

Indexing strategies are implemented through the `create_performance_indexes` method, which creates a series of optimized indexes using the `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` command to avoid table locking during index creation. Key indexes include:
- `idx_expert_models_status_priority` on the `enhanced_expert_models` table for filtering by active status and expertise areas
- `idx_expert_predictions_game_time` on the `expert_predictions_enhanced` table for efficient game-based queries
- `idx_ai_council_round_performance` on the `ai_council_selections` table for council performance analysis
- `idx_predictions_confidence_accuracy` as a partial index on `expert_predictions_enhardened` for high-confidence predictions
- `idx_expert_trends_recent` as a time-decayed index on `expert_performance_analytics` for recent performance trends

These indexes are specifically designed to accelerate the most common query patterns in the application, particularly those involving expert predictions, council selections, and performance analytics. The system also includes automated optimization maintenance through the `optimize_tables` method, which periodically runs `ANALYZE` to update table statistics, `VACUUM` to reclaim storage, and `REINDEX` operations on critical tables to maintain index efficiency.

## Redis Configuration Parameters

The Redis configuration in `redis_config.py` provides a robust caching infrastructure with parameters optimized for efficiency, appropriate eviction policies, and flexible deployment options. The configuration is managed through the `RedisConfig` class and the `RedisDeploymentManager`, which together define the caching behavior and deployment strategy.

Caching efficiency is governed by several key parameters in the `RedisConfig` class. The `max_memory` parameter, set via the `REDIS_MAX_MEMORY` environment variable with a default of "256mb", defines the memory limit for the Redis instance, preventing unbounded memory growth. The `max_connections` parameter, defaulting to 20, controls the maximum number of simultaneous client connections, balancing resource usage with concurrent access needs. Connection timeouts are carefully tuned with `socket_timeout` and `socket_connect_timeout` both defaulting to 5 seconds, ensuring that stalled connections are terminated promptly without being overly aggressive.

Eviction policies are configured through the `max_memory_policy` parameter, which defaults to "allkeys-lru" (Least Recently Used). This policy ensures that when the memory limit is reached, the least recently accessed keys are evicted first, which is optimal for a prediction API where recent data is typically more relevant than older data. The configuration also supports other policies like "volatile-lru" for keys with expiration times, providing flexibility based on specific use cases. The system includes comprehensive monitoring capabilities with a `health_check_interval` that defaults to 30 seconds, allowing for regular health checks and early detection of potential issues.

Cluster settings and deployment options are managed by the `RedisDeploymentManager`, which supports multiple deployment types through the `RedisDeploymentType` enum: LOCAL, DOCKER, CLOUD, and MANAGED. For Docker deployments, the system generates a `docker-compose.redis.yml` file that configures a Redis container with persistent storage, a Redis Commander UI for management, and proper health checks. The generated Redis configuration file includes optimized settings for production use, such as append-only file persistence with `appendfsync everysec`, snapshotting configurations, and client output buffer limits. The deployment manager also creates monitoring scripts that check memory usage, connection counts, and overall Redis health, with alerts triggered when memory usage exceeds 80% or 90% thresholds.

The configuration also includes advanced Redis features like slow log monitoring with `slowlog-log-slower-than` set to 10,000 microseconds (10ms), allowing for the identification of performance bottlenecks in Redis operations. Client output buffer limits are configured to prevent individual clients from consuming excessive memory, with different limits for normal, replica, and pubsub connections. These comprehensive settings ensure that the Redis cache operates efficiently, maintains data integrity, and provides reliable performance under varying load conditions.

## Production Performance Settings

The production configuration in `production.py` defines critical performance-related settings that govern request handling, worker concurrency, and resource management in the live environment. These settings are encapsulated in the `ProductionConfig` class, which loads values from environment variables with sensible defaults for development and staging environments.

Request timeouts are managed through multiple layers of configuration. The API client configuration in `get_api_config_dict` sets specific timeouts for different data sources: 30 seconds for primary sources (Odds API and SportsData IO), 20 seconds for fallback sources (ESPN API and NFL API), and 25 seconds for Rapid API. These differentiated timeouts reflect the reliability and expected response times of each data source, with primary sources given longer timeouts due to their critical importance. The configuration also includes socket timeouts for Redis connections, set to 5 seconds, ensuring that cache operations do not become bottlenecks.

Worker concurrency is implicitly managed through the connection pool settings and rate limiting configurations. While not explicitly defined as "worker" settings, the system's asynchronous architecture with asyncpg for database connections and Redis for caching enables high concurrency. The database connection pool can scale to 50 connections, allowing for substantial parallel database operations. The rate limiting configuration in `RateLimitConfig` controls the number of requests to external APIs, with limits of 500 for Odds API, 1,000 for SportsData IO, 1,000
