## Ensemble Learning Architecture

The NFL Predictor API employs a sophisticated ensemble learning framework that combines multiple machine learning models, including XGBoost and scikit-learn-based algorithms, to maximize prediction accuracy. This architecture leverages the strengths of diverse models through strategic integration and weighted consensus mechanisms. The ensemble system is implemented in `ensemble_predictor.py` and coordinated through the `advanced_model_trainer.py` module, which manages model diversity, training synchronization, and performance monitoring. Each base model specializes in different aspects of game prediction, such as point spreads, totals, or player performance metrics, allowing the ensemble to capture complex, non-linear relationships in NFL game data.
