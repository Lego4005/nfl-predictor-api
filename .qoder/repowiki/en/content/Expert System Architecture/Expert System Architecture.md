## Introduction
The AI Expert System forms the core of the prediction engine, comprising 15 autonomous experts with distinct personality profiles that influence their decision-making approaches. This system leverages personality-driven analysis rather than domain specialization, ensuring all experts have equal access to data while interpreting it through unique cognitive lenses. The architecture integrates persistent memory, learning from past predictions, and a self-healing mechanism that adapts expert parameters based on performance. This document details the comprehensive system design, including expert lifecycle management, memory retention, consensus algorithms, and configuration options for extending the system.

## Core Expert System Architecture

The autonomous expert system orchestrates 15 personality-driven experts through a centralized framework that manages their lifecycle, memory integration, and collaborative prediction processes. Each expert operates as an independent agent with specialized decision-making characteristics while sharing access to universal game data. The system connects to Supabase for persistent storage of expert
