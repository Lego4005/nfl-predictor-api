## Introduction
The AI Expert System forms the core of the prediction engine, comprising 15 autonomous experts with distinct personality profiles that influence their decision-making approaches. This system leverages personality-driven analysis rather than domain specialization, ensuring all experts have equal access to data while interpreting it through unique cognitive lenses. The architecture integrates persistent memory, learning from past predictions, and a self-healing mechanism that adapts expert parameters based on performance. This document details the comprehensive system design, including expert lifecycle management, memory retention, consensus algorithms, and configuration options for extending the system.

## Core Expert System Architecture

The autonomous expert system orchestrates 15 personality-driven experts through a centralized framework that manages their lifecycle, memory integration, and collaborative prediction processes. Each expert operates as an independent agent with specialized decision-making characteristics while sharing access to universal game data. The system connects to Supabase for persistent storage of expert states, memories, and predictions.

## Personality-Driven Expert Design

The expert configuration system defines 15 unique expert personalities with distinct analytical approaches. Each expert has a unique `ExpertType` (e.g., `MOMENTUM_RIDER`, `CONTRARIAN_REBEL`, `CHAOS_THEORY_BELIEVER`) and an `ExpertConfiguration` containing name, description, analytical focus weights, confidence threshold, decision-making style, and temporal parameters.

**Temporal Parameters**
Each expert has different temporal decay characteristics:
- **Momentum Rider**: 14-day half-life (prioritizes recent events)
- **Conservative Analyzer**: 60-day half-life (values longer-term patterns)
- **Weather Specialist**: 730-day half-life (physics-based patterns change slowly)
- **Chaos Theorist**: 7-day half-life (rapidly discounts past information)

**Analytical Focus**
Experts assign different weights to game factors:
- **Weather Specialist**: Weather temperature (0.95), wind speed (0.95)
- **Contrarian Rebel**: Public betting bias (0.95), crowd psychology (0.85)
- **Momentum Rider**: Recent win-loss trends (0.95), team momentum (0.90)

## Memory Integration System

The memory system implements a four-dimensional reasoning-enhanced vector memory architecture that captures not just game outcomes but the reasoning behind decisions and post-game reflections.

### Four-Dimensional Reasoning Memory
1. **Reasoning Chain Embedding**: Pre-game thought process and decision logic
2. **Learning Reflection Embedding**: Post-game analysis of what was right/wrong
3. **Contextual Embedding**: Environmental and situational factors
4. **Market Embedding**: Betting dynamics and market sentiment

### Temporal Decay Calculator
Uses exponential decay formula: `0.5^(age_days / half_life_days)`
- **Momentum Rider**: 0.5^(30/14) = 0.25 (25% weight for 30-day old memory)
- **Conservative Analyzer**: 0.5^(30/60) = 0.71 (71% weight for 30-day old memory)

### Memory Retrieval System
Retrieves relevant memories based on:
- **Similarity scoring**: Expert-specific algorithms for weather, market, or divisional patterns
- **Temporal decay**: Expert-specific half-life parameters
- **Final scoring**: Weighted combination of similarity and temporal components

## Expert Council Voting Mechanism

The expert council voting mechanism combines predictions from the 15 experts through a weighted consensus algorithm. The system uses a performance-based weighting system where experts with higher accuracy in specific domains receive greater influence on the final prediction.

**Voting Process**
1. **Expert Selection**: Identify top-performing experts for current game context
2. **Weight Assignment**: Assign weights based on historical accuracy and confidence
3. **Consensus Generation**: Calculate weighted average of predictions
4. **Final Output**: Generate unified prediction with confidence interval

## Performance Tracking and Self-Healing

The performance tracking system continuously monitors expert accuracy and implements self-healing mechanisms to adjust expert parameters based on performance.

### Monitoring Checkpoints
- **Game 20**: Memory storage health verification
- **Game 50**: Expert state evolution analysis
- **Game 100**: Memory retrieval relevance validation
- **Game 200**: Reasoning evolution assessment

### Self-Healing System
The adaptation engine automatically adjusts expert parameters:
- **Confidence calibration**: Modifies confidence thresholds based on over/under-confidence patterns
- **Weight adjustment**: Updates analytical focus weights based on factor validation
- **Temporal parameter tuning**: Adjusts half-life values based on prediction success

## Configuration and Extensibility

The system supports flexible configuration and extensibility through modular design.

### Adding New Expert Types
1. Define new `ExpertType` enum value
2. Create `ExpertConfiguration` with analytical focus weights
3. Implement decision-making logic
4. Register with expert configuration manager

### Tuning Personality Parameters
Configurable parameters include:
- **Analytical focus weights**: Adjust factor importance (0.0-1.0)
- **Confidence thresholds**: Set baseline confidence levels
- **Temporal parameters**: Configure half-life days and weighting
- **Decision-making style**: Specify analytical approach

## Enhanced LLM Expert Agent

The enhanced LLM expert agent integrates real LLM calls for prediction generation while maintaining fallback simulation capabilities.

### LLM Integration Process
1. **System Prompt Creation**: Convert expert configuration to LLM prompt
2. **Game Context Prompt**: Build detailed game analysis with retrieved memories
3. **OpenRouter API Call**: Use Llama 3.1 8B model with rate limiting
4. **Response Parsing**: Extract structured prediction from LLM response

### Fallback Simulation
If LLM calls fail, use expert-specific logic:
- **Momentum Rider**: Prioritize recent team performance and streaks
- **Contrarian Rebel**: Fade public betting and popular narratives
- **Weather Specialist**: Emphasize weather impact on game flow
- **Chaos Theorist**: Low confidence, acknowledge unpredictability
