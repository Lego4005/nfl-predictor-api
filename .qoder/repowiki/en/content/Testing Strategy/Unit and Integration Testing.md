## Unit Testing Strategies

Unit testing in the NFL Predictor API follows best practices for test isolation, dependency injection, and assertion patterns. The framework leverages pytest fixtures to manage test dependencies and ensure consistent test environments across different test suites.

### Test Isolation
Each unit test is designed to test a single component in isolation, with external dependencies mocked using pytest fixtures. This approach ensures that tests are reliable and not affected by external factors such as network connectivity or database state.

### Dependency Injection
The testing framework uses dependency injection to provide test doubles for external services. This allows for comprehensive testing of components that interact with external APIs, databases, and caching systems without requiring actual connections.

### Assertion Patterns
The unit tests employ clear and specific assertion patterns to validate component behavior. Assertions cover both expected outcomes and edge cases, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
