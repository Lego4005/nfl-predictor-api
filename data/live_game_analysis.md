## KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working
- **Q2 prediction was PERFECT** (SF 10 - LA 7)
- **First score/TD predictions correct**
- **Winner prediction on track**
- **Over/Under on pace**

### What's Not Working
- **Halftime score way off** (predicted LA leading, SF actually dominating)
- **Q1 LA score wrong** (predicted 7, actual 0)
- **Game flow wrong** (predicted close game, SF dominating)

### The Big Question
Can LA come back? Our prediction says final is SF 27 - LA 24 (SF wins by 3).

Current pace: SF 17 - LA 7 at half ‚Üí SF needs 10 more, LA needs 17 more

**Prediction for 2nd half:**
- We predicted: SF 10 - LA 10 (tie in 2nd half)
- Reality needs: LA must outscore SF 17-10 to hit our prediction

## UPDATED PROBABILITY

Based on halftime score:
- **SF win probability: ~85%** (up from 70% prediction)
- **LA comeback needed: 17 points in 2nd half**
- **Our final score prediction (SF 27 - LA 24) requires LA to score 17 in 2nd half**

## EARLY VERDICT

**Accuracy so far: ~50%**
- Got some things right (first score, Q2 exact)
- Got some things very wrong (halftime score, game flow)
- Exactly what we expected: barely better than random

The memory system gave us team averages, but didn't predict SF would dominate early.
