### üéØ FEATURE ENGINEERING PIPELINE

Our system transforms raw game data into 13 engineered features that capture the essential factors influencing NFL game outcomes:

**Core Statistical Features**:
1. **Offensive Advantage**: Home team offensive rating - Away team offensive rating
2. **Defensive Advantage**: Away team defensive rating - Home team defensive rating
3. **Total Offensive Power**: Combined offensive capabilities of both teams
4. **Total Defensive Strength**: Combined defensive capabilities of both teams

**Environmental & Situational Features**:
5. **Weather Impact**: Composite score based on temperature, wind, precipitation
6. **Rest Advantage**: Difference in days of rest between teams
7. **Venue Factors**: Home field advantage quantification
8. **Divisional Game Multiplier**: Intensity factor for division rivalry games
9. **Prime Time Multiplier**: Performance factor for nationally televised games

**Advanced Matchup Features**:
10. **Home Offensive vs Away Defensive**: Direct matchup strength analysis
11. **Away Offensive vs Home Defensive**: Reverse matchup strength analysis
12. **Dome Game Indicator**: Weather-controlled environment flag
13. **Rivalry Intensity**: Historical competition level between teams

### üßÆ EXPERT WEIGHTING SYSTEM

Each of our 15 experts employs a sophisticated weighting system that emphasizes their areas of specialization:

```python
Expert Weighting Formula:
Final_Prediction = Œ£(Expert_i * Weight_i * Confidence_i * Situation_Modifier_i)

Where:
- Expert_i = Individual expert prediction
- Weight_i = Expert's historical accuracy weight
- Confidence_i = Expert's confidence in current prediction
- Situation_Modifier_i = Situational relevance multiplier
```

**Dynamic Weight Adjustment**:
- Weights update after each game based on prediction accuracy
- Situational multipliers activate based on game context (weather, injuries, etc.)
- Confidence scores incorporate both model uncertainty and expert disagreement

### üìä PREDICTION CONFIDENCE CALCULATION

Our system generates confidence scores through a multi-factor approach:

1. **ML Model Confidence**: Based on prediction probability margins
2. **Expert Consensus Level**: Measured by agreement percentage across experts
3. **Historical Accuracy**: Weighted by recent performance metrics
4. **Data Quality Score**: Based on completeness and recency of input data
5. **Situational Uncertainty**: Adjusted for unusual circumstances or missing data

**Final Confidence Formula**:
```
Confidence = (ML_Confidence * 0.4) + (Expert_Consensus * 0.3) +
             (Historical_Accuracy * 0.2) + (Data_Quality * 0.1)
```

### üîÑ CONTINUOUS LEARNING SYSTEM

Our platform incorporates automated learning mechanisms that improve accuracy over time:

**Post-Game Analysis**:
- Automatic comparison of predictions vs. actual outcomes
- Expert weight adjustments based on performance
- Model retraining triggers when accuracy drops below thresholds
- Feature importance recalculation with new data

**Seasonal Adaptations**:
- Weekly model updates incorporating latest game results
- Seasonal trend detection and adjustment
