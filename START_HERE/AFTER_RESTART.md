# 🔄 After Machine Restart - Do This First!

## ⚡ Immediate Actions

### 1. Check if Game is Final
```bash
python3 scripts/post_game_analysis.py
```

**What this does:**
- Fetches final score from ESPN API
- Scores all 75+ predictions
- Generates accuracy report
- Saves to `data/post_game_analysis_[timestamp].txt`

---

### 2. Review Results

**Our Predictions** (from 60 games of memory):
```
Final Score: SF 27 - LA 24 (SF wins by 3)
Halftime: SF 17 - LA 14
75+ detailed predictions
```

**At Halftime** (when we last checked):
```
Actual: SF 17 - LA 7 (SF dominating)
Accuracy: ~50% (some perfect, some way off)
```

**Final Results**: Run the script above to find out!

### 3. Key Questions to Answer

After running the analysis script, check:

1. **Did SF win?** (We predicted yes)
2. **Was final score close to 27-24?** (Our prediction)
3. **Did OVER 47.5 hit?** (We predicted yes)
4. **Which predictions were accurate?**
   - Core game (winner, score, spread, total)
   - Quarter-by-quarter
   - Player props
   - Team statistics

---

### 4. What We Expected

**Realistic Accuracy: 50-53%**

Why so low?
- We trained on individual team games
- We predicted a head-to-head matchup
- Missing matchup-specific data
- Missing contextual factors
- Just averaging team statistics

**This is the baseline to beat!**

### 5. Files to Review

📊 **Predictions**: `data/tonight_comprehensive_prediction.txt`
📈 **Halftime Check**: `data/live_game_analysis.md`
🎯 **Final Analysis**: `data/post_game_analysis_*.txt` (after running script)
📖 **Full Guide**: `START_HERE/README.md`

---

### 6. Next Steps Based on Results

**If accuracy is 50-55%:**
- System works as expected (baseline)
- Need to add matchup-specific features
- Need opponent-adjusted statistics
- Need contextual data

**If accuracy is 60%+:**
- Better than expected!
- Memory system has real signal
- Still room for improvement

**If accuracy is <50%:**
- Worse than random guessing
- Need to debug memory retrieval
- May need different training approach

---

### 7. Improvements to Make

1. **Add head-to-head historical data**
   - Train on actual SF vs LA games from past seasons

2. **Add opponent-adjusted stats**
   - How SF performs vs top-10 defenses
   - How LA's offense performs vs SF's defense

3. **Add contextual features**
   - Injuries, weather, rest days
   - Playoff implications
   - Recent form (weight last 5 games higher)

4. **Test on multiple games**
   - Measure accuracy across full season
   - Identify which prediction types work best

5. **Multi-expert ensemble**
   - Run all 15 experts
   - Aggregate with voting
   - Track expert performance

### 8. The Big Picture

**What We Built:**
- Episodic memory storage system ✅
- Memory retrieval for predictions ✅
- Comprehensive prediction structure ✅
- Validation framework ✅

**What We Learned:**
- Memory improves single-team predictions (10% boost) ✅
- Team averages ≠ matchup predictions ❌
- Need matchup-specific features ❌
- Current system is baseline (~50%) ✅

**What's Next:**
- Measure tonight's actual accuracy
- Identify gaps and improvements
- Iterate based on data
- Build toward 60%+ accuracy
