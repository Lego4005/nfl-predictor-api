## üß† Learning Engine Behavior

### Positive Adjustments (7 games)
Increased confidence when factors aligned with past success:
- Game 3: +4.1% (ATL prediction, but wrong)
- Game 6: +2.0% (NE prediction, but wrong)
- Game 11: +1.8% (DEN prediction, CORRECT)
- Game 15: +1.5% (BUF prediction, CORRECT)

### Negative Adjustments (4 games)
Decreased confidence when factors suggested caution:
- Game 13: -2.7% (DET prediction, wrong)
- Game 16: -2.5% (MIN prediction, CORRECT)
- Game 5: -1.0% (IND prediction, CORRECT)
- Game 9: -0.6% (WSH prediction, CORRECT)

### Minimal Adjustment (6 games)
Near-zero adjustments when factors were neutral:
- Game 10: -0.0% (JAX prediction, CORRECT)
- Game 4: +0.2% (CLE prediction, wrong)
- Game 17: -0.4% (GB prediction, CORRECT)

## üîç Factor Analysis

**Top 3 Factors from LLM** (Game 1 example):
1. `defensive_strength`: 0.90 - "PHI allows 11 PPG less than DAL"
2. `red_zone_efficiency`: 0.80 - "PHI converts at 118.6% vs DAL's 79.1%"
3. `offensive_efficiency`: 0.60 - "Comparable scoring: DAL 28.5 PPG vs PHI 27.0"

**Learning Engine Top 3** (after 19 games):
1. `recent_momentum`
2. `special_teams`
3. `turnover_differential`

**Observation**: LLM and learning engine value different factors - LLM focuses on concrete stats (defensive strength, red zone %), while learning engine identifies momentum and turnovers as strongest predictors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered

### 1. Odds API Authentication Failures
```
ERROR:src.services.expert_data_access_layer:The Odds API error: 401
```
**Impact**: No betting odds available for predictions
**Frequency**: Every game (100%)
**Solution Needed**: Fix API key or authentication method

### 2. Expert ID Mapping Issues
```
WARNING:src.services.expert_data_access_layer:Unknown expert_id: conservative_analyzer, using THE_ANALYST
```
**Impact**: Using generic expert profile instead of personality-specific data
**Frequency**: Every game (100%)
**Solution Needed**: Map `conservative_analyzer` to correct expert profile

### 3. Missing Injury Data
```
WARNING:src.services.expert_data_access_layer:No injury data for Week 1
```
**Impact**: Predictions missing key injury context
**Frequency**: Most games
**Solution Needed**: Ensure injury API has Week 1-2 data

### 4. Weather Not Integrated
```
INFO:src.services.expert_data_access_layer:Weather data not yet integrated for PHI
```
**Impact**: Missing weather conditions (wind, temperature)
**Frequency**: Every game (100%)
**Solution Needed**: Complete weather API integration

### 5. Slow Execution
**Impact**: 17 games took ~10 minutes (35 seconds per game)
**Breakdown**:
- API data fetching: ~5-8 seconds
- Claude LLM call: ~15-20 seconds
- Database operations: ~5 seconds
- Learning update: ~2-3 seconds

**Solution Needed**:
- Cache API data for repeated games
- Batch Claude requests when possible
- Optimize database writes
