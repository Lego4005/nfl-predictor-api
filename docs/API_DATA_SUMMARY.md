## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Verification (28 Predictions)

### Quarter/Half Predictions (8) - GOOD NEWS

**Quarter scores ARE available** in SportsData.io:

- `ScoreQuarter1`, `ScoreQuarter2`, `ScoreQuarter3`, `ScoreQuarter4`, `ScoreOvertime`

**Status**: Can implement, just need to verify quarter-by-quarter breakdown in API response.

**Predictions**:

- Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 Winner
- Q1/Q2 Total Points
- First Half Winner
- First Half Total

### Player Props (12) - Historical Data Available

**Good for training ML models**, but live odds limited:

**Available in SportsData.io**:

- QB: `PassingYards`, `PassingTouchdowns`, `PassingInterceptions`
- RB: `RushingYards`, `RushingTouchdowns`
- WR/TE: `ReceivingYards`, `Receptions`, `ReceivingTouchdowns`
- K: `FieldGoalsMade`, `FieldGoalsAttempted`
- DEF: `Sacks`, `Interceptions`

**Status**: Can build prediction models with historical data. The Odds API player props require special access or different markets.

### Special Events (8) - Need Play-by-Play

These require detailed play-by-play data:

- First Score Type
- Longest Touchdown
- Safety Scored
- Game Goes to Overtime (can use `ScoreOvertime` field!)
- Successful 2-Point Conversion
- Punt/Kick Return TDs
- Defensive TD

**Status**: SportsData.io has "Play-by-Play" endpoint - need to test it.

## üöÄ Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: MVP (2-3 weeks)

**Focus on 15 fully-supported predictions**:

1. Game outcomes (winner, spread, total, margin, moneyline)
2. Team performance metrics (yards, TDs, turnovers, etc.)

**Why**: Clean data, proven models exist, users understand these markets.

### Phase 2: Quarters & Halves (1 week)

**Add 8 quarter/half predictions**:

- Verify quarter scores in API
- Build quarter-specific models
- Test with historical data

**Risk**: Low - data appears available in `ScoreQuarter1-4` fields

### Phase 3: Player Props (2-3 weeks)

**Add 12 player prop predictions**:

- Use historical stats for model training
- Start with QB/RB/WR (most popular)
- Consider adding PrizePicks/Underdog API for live prop odds

**Risk**: Medium - need to validate live odds availability

### Phase 4: Special Events (2-4 weeks)

**Add 8 special event predictions**:

- Test SportsData.io Play-by-Play endpoint
- Extract special scoring events
- Lower priority (less user interest)

**Risk**: High - requires detailed play parsing

## üí∞ API Usage Considerations

### SportsData.io

- **Pricing**: Unknown (check your plan)
- **Usage**: Test used 4 endpoints successfully
- **Optimization**: Cache historical data, only fetch new games

### The Odds API

- **Requests Remaining**: 492 (as of test)
- **Markets**: h2h, spreads, totals confirmed working
- **Optimization**:
  - Only fetch odds for upcoming games
  - Cache odds for 15-30 minutes
  - Use webhook updates if available

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Test Quarter Data**: Verify `ScoreQuarter1-4` fields are populated

   ```python
   # Check if quarter scores are available
   python scripts/test_paid_apis.py --check-quarters
   ```

2. **Test Play-by-Play**: See if special events are available

   ```python
   # Check play-by-play endpoint
   python scripts/test_paid_apis.py --check-plays
   ```

3. **Plan Data Pipeline**:
   - Backfill historical data (2020-2024 seasons)
   - Set up daily game score ingestion
   - Configure odds polling (hourly before games)

4. **Start Building**: Focus on 15 core predictions
   - Build models with historical data
   - Set up prediction pipeline
   - Create API endpoints
   - Build frontend UI
