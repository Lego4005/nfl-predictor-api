- **Severity Levels**: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL with appropriate routing
- **Cooldown Periods**: Prevents alert spam with configurable cooldown times
- **Alert Management**: Acknowledgment and resolution workflows
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Support for log, webhook, and extensible channels

#### Dashboard & Visualization
- **Real-time Data**: Live metric updates with WebSocket-like refresh
- **Performance Charts**: Time-series visualization with Chart.js
- **SLA Compliance**: Visual indicators for performance target adherence
- **Service Health**: Overall system health status with detailed breakdowns
- **Historical Data**: Time-range filtering for trend analysis

#### Performance Targets
Based on system requirements, monitoring tracks:
- **Vector Retrieval P95**: ≤ 100ms (HNSW + combined embeddings)
- **End-to-End P95**: ≤ 6000ms (expert prediction pipeline)
- **Council Projection P95**: ≤ 150ms (coherence projection)
- **Schema Pass Rate**: ≥ 98.5% (JSON validation success)
- **Critic/Repair Loops**: ≤ 1.2 average (prediction quality)

### System Integration

#### Service Coverage
- **Memory Retrieval Service**: Vector search latency, cache hit rates, index performance
- **Expert Prediction Service**: Prediction latency, schema validation, critic/repair loops
- **Council Selection Service**: Selection latency, expert pool management
- **Coherence Projection Service**: Projection latency, constraint satisfaction
- **API Layer**: Request/response times, error rates, throughput
- **Neo4j Provenance**: Write latency, merge conflicts, relationship creation

#### Monitoring Patterns
- **Decorator-Based**: `@monitor_performance` for automatic function monitoring
- **Context Manager**: `with MonitoringContext()` for operation blocks
- **Direct Recording**: `monitoring.record_metric()` for custom metrics
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk metric recording

### Testing & Validation

#### Test Coverage
1. **Service Initialization**: Metric registration, alert rule setup, background processing
2. **Metric Recording**: Various metric types, tag support, aggregation
3. **Alert Triggering**: Threshold breaches, severity handling, notification channels
4. **Dashboard Generation**: Data formatting, time filtering, service-specific views
5. **Performance Summary**: SLA compliance, recommendations, trend analysis
6. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous operation, background processing
7. **Integration Testing**: Multi-service simulation, load testing, graceful shutdown

#### Performance Results
- **All Tests Passed**: ✅ 100% test success rate
- **Alert Response**: < 1 second alert triggering on threshold breach
- **Dashboard Generation**: < 500ms for comprehensive dashboard data
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient with configurable retention and cleanup
- **Thread Safety**: No race conditions in concurrent metric recording

### Deployment & Configuration

#### Configuration Options
```python
{
    'retention_hours': 24,                    # Data retention period
    'alert_evaluation_interval_seconds': 30, # Alert check frequency
    'dashboard_refresh_interval_seconds': 10, # Dashboard update rate
    'enable_alerting': True,                  # Alert system toggle
    'alert_channels': ['log', 'webhook'],     # Notification channels
    'webhook_url': None                       # Webhook endpoint
}
```

#### Environment Integration
- **FastAPI Integration**: Ready for inclusion in existing API structure
- **Background Processing**: Daemon threads for continuous monitoring
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and shutdown procedures
- **Scalability**: Thread pool for concurrent operations

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Metric Recording
```python
monitoring = PerformanceMonitoringService()
monitoring.record_metric('vector_retrieval_latency_ms', 85.3,
                        tags={'expert_id': 'conservative_analyzer'})
```

#### Function Monitoring
```python
@monitor_performance("expert_prediction", service="expert_prediction")
async def generate_prediction(expert_id: str, game_id: str):
    # Function automatically monitored for latency and errors
    return await prediction_logic(expert_id, game_id)
```

#### Dashboard Data Access
```python
# Get real-time dashboard data
dashboard_data = monitoring.get_dashboard_data(
    service="memory_retrieval",
    time_range_minutes=60
)
```
