## üéØ Recommendations for System Improvement

### 1. Scoring Model Calibration
- **Issue**: 63.8% overestimation of total points
- **Solution**: Adjust offensive ratings downward or increase defensive weightings
- **Target**: Reduce average total prediction by 15-20 points

### 2. Home Field Adjustment
- **Issue**: Overvalued home advantage (3 wrong picks)
- **Solution**: Reduce home field coefficient from current levels
- **Target**: Cap home field advantage at 2.5 points max

### 3. Expert Weighting Optimization
- **Current**: Equal weighting (6.67% each)
- **Proposed**: Performance-based dynamic weighting
  - Pattern/Historical: 15%
  - Coaching/Strategy: 12%
  - Market-Based: 12%
  - Contrarian: 5%
  - Others: Proportional

### 4. Defensive Metrics Enhancement

- **Solution**: Increase defensive efficiency factors
- **Target**: Better capture low-scoring game potential

### 5. Consensus Mechanism
- **Current**: Simple majority/average
- **Proposed**: Weighted consensus with confidence factors
- **Formula**: (Prediction √ó Confidence √ó Historical Accuracy)
