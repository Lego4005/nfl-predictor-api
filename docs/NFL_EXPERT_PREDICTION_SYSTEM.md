    injury_factor * weight_2 +
    market_factor * weight_3 +
    team_factor * weight_4 +
    coaching_factor * weight_5

# Apply personality modifier
personality_adjustment = base * personality_traits
confidence_boost = personality.confidence_level

final_prediction = personality_adjustment * confidence_boost
```

### Factor Weights by Personality Type

## ðŸŽ¯ Consensus Calculation

### Top 5 Expert Consensus

```python
# Sort experts by confidence
sorted_experts = sort_by_confidence(all_predictions)
top_5 = sorted_experts[:5]

# Weight by confidence
for expert in top_5:
    weight = expert.confidence_overall
    consensus_score += expert.prediction * weight

final_consensus = consensus_score / sum_of_weights
```

### Dynamic Weight Adjustment

```python
# Weekly performance update
if expert.last_week_accuracy > 0.6:
    expert.weight *= 1.1  # Increase weight
elif expert.last_week_accuracy < 0.4:
    expert.weight *= 0.9  # Decrease weight

# Normalize weights
total_weight = sum(all_weights)
normalized_weights = [w/total_weight for w in all_weights]
```
