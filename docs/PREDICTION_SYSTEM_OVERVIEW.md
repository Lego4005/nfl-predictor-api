## Prediction Methodologies

### Base Model Training Process

1. **Data Collection**

   ```python
   Sources:
   - Historical game data (10+ years)
   - Team statistics
   - Player statistics
   - Weather data
   - Injury reports
   - Betting market data
   ```

2. **Feature Engineering** (100+ features)
   - **Team Features**: Power ratings, ELO scores, recent form
   - **Matchup Features**: Head-to-head history, divisional games
   - **Situational Features**: Rest days, travel distance, time zones
   - **Statistical Features**: DVOA, EPA, success rates
   - **Market Features**: Spread movement, betting percentages

3. **Model Training Pipeline**

   ```python
   1. Data preprocessing & scaling
   2. Feature selection (importance > 0.01)
   3. Cross-validation (TimeSeriesSplit, 5 folds)
   4. Hyperparameter tuning (Optuna, 100 trials)
   5. Model ensemble creation
   6. Calibration (isotonic regression)
   ```

### Weather Impact Analysis

The system calculates weather impacts on:

- **Passing**: Wind speed > 15mph = -15% efficiency
- **Kicking**: Wind speed > 20mph = -25% FG accuracy
- **Total scoring**: Precipitation > 0.3in = -8% total points
- **Dome games**: No weather impact applied

### Momentum Calculation

```python
momentum_factors = {
    'recent_scoring': 0.30,    # Points in last 5 minutes
    'turnover_differential': 0.25,
    'yards_per_play_trend': 0.20,
    'third_down_conversion': 0.15,
    'time_of_possession': 0.10
}
```

## Ensemble & Consensus Systems

### Model Council Voting System

The system uses a **dynamic weighted voting** mechanism:

1. **Council Members** (12+ models):
   - Statistical: ELO, Spread Analyzer, Momentum Tracker, Bayesian
   - AI Models: Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek v3
   - ML Models: Neural Network Ensemble, Random Forest

2. **Weight Calculation**:

   ```python
   weight = base_weight * accuracy_multiplier * recency_factor
   - base_weight: Equal starting weight
   - accuracy_multiplier: Recent 10-game accuracy
   - recency_factor: More weight to recent performance
   ```

3. **Consensus Building**:

   ```python
   consensus = Σ(model_prediction * model_weight) / Σ(model_weights)
   ```

### Stacking Ensemble

**Meta-learner approach**:

- Level 0: Base models make predictions
- Level 1: LightGBM meta-model combines predictions
- Cross-validation prevents overfitting

    historical_accuracy * 0.25,        # Past accuracy in similar games
    feature_quality_score * 0.20,      # Data completeness
    market_alignment * 0.10,           # Agreement with betting markets
    sample_size_factor * 0.10          # Amount of relevant data
])
```

### Confidence Levels

- **Very High** (85-100%): Strong model agreement, excellent historical performance
- **High** (70-84%): Good model consensus, solid track record
- **Medium** (55-69%): Moderate agreement, average historical accuracy
- **Low** (<55%): Model disagreement, limited data, or poor past performance
