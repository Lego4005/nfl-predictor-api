# AI Council Confidence Pool - Complete Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Current Context**: Week 4 of 2025 NFL Season
**Status**: Frontend mockup complete, needs real data integration and accountability systems

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Building a sophisticated AI prediction platform where 15 expert personalities compete via weighted voting system. Each expert has virtual bankroll accountability - they must bet on their predictions or reveal lack of confidence. Frontend showcases "AI experts fighting it out" with real-time data ingestion from news, weather, and social media.

---

## 🎯 What We've Built So Far

### Frontend Components

- **Confidence Pool Page** (`src/pages/ConfidencePool/ConfidencePoolPage.tsx`)
  - Shows top 5 council members dynamically selected each week
  - Displays confidence-ranked picks (1-16) for each expert
  - Shows vote weights based on category-specific specialization
  - Expandable reasoning cards with personality-driven explanations
  - Expert filtering and stats display

### Backend Architecture (Existing)

- **15 Expert Personalities** (`src/data/expertPersonalities.ts`)
  - Conservative Analyzer, Risk-Taking Gambler, Contrarian Rebel, Value Hunter, Momentum Rider
  - Fundamentalist Scholar, Chaos Theory Believer, Gut Instinct Expert, Statistics Purist
  - Trend Reversal Specialist, Popular Narrative Fader, Sharp Money Follower
  - Underdog Champion, Consensus Follower, Market Inefficiency Exploiter

- **Council Selection System** (`src/ml/expert_competition/council_selector.py`)
  - Weighted scoring: Accuracy (35%), Recent Performance (25%), Consistency (20%), Calibration (10%), Specialization (10%)
  - 4-week evaluation window
  - Minimum 10 predictions for eligibility
  - Dynamic weekly rotation based on performance

- **Weighted Voting System** (`src/ml/expert_competition/voting_consensus.py`)
  - Vote weight formula: `(Accuracy × 0.4) + (Recent × 0.3) + (Confidence × 0.2) + (Specialization × 0.1)`
  - Category-specific weight adjustment (e.g., "The Analyst" has 90% specialization weight for statistical predictions)
  - Numeric consensus: Weighted average
  - Categorical consensus: Weighted voting
  - Agreement level calculation

- **Memory & Learning** (Existing tables)
  - `expert_episodic_memories` - Game experiences with emotional encoding
  - `expert_belief_revisions` - Tracks when experts change their minds
  - `expert_reasoning_chains` - Internal chain-of-thought reasoning
  - Memory decay and retrieval systems

## 🔥 CRITICAL GAPS & IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES

### 🚨 Priority 1: Virtual Bankroll Accountability System

**Concept**: Experts must "put their money where their mouth is"

#### How It Works

1. **Starting Bankroll**: Each expert starts season with $10,000 virtual cash
2. **Mandatory Betting**: If expert makes prediction with 70%+ confidence, they MUST bet on it
3. **Bet Sizing**: Bet size scales with confidence
   - 70-79% confidence → Bet 5% of bankroll ($500)
   - 80-89% confidence → Bet 10% of bankroll ($1,000)
   - 90%+ confidence → Bet 20% of bankroll ($2,000)
4. **Real Vegas Odds**: Use actual Vegas lines for payout calculations
5. **Elimination**: If bankroll drops to $0, expert is OUT for the season
6. **Confidence Validation**: If expert says 85% confidence but only bets 2%, shows lack of true conviction

#### Database Schema Needed

```sql
-- Table already exists: expert_virtual_bankrolls
-- Need to add:
ALTER TABLE expert_virtual_bankrolls ADD COLUMN bets_placed JSONB;
ALTER TABLE expert_virtual_bankrolls ADD COLUMN season_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active'; -- active/eliminated
ALTER TABLE expert_virtual_bankrolls ADD COLUMN elimination_date TIMESTAMP;

-- New table for bet tracking
CREATE TABLE expert_virtual_bets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    expert_id VARCHAR(50) REFERENCES expert_models(expert_id),
    game_id VARCHAR(100),
    prediction_category VARCHAR(100), -- winner, spread, total, prop
    bet_amount NUMERIC(10,2),
    vegas_odds VARCHAR(20),
    prediction_confidence NUMERIC(5,2),
    bet_placed_at TIMESTAMP,
    result VARCHAR(20), -- pending/won/lost/push
    payout_amount NUMERIC(10,2),
    bankroll_before NUMERIC(10,2),
    bankroll_after NUMERIC(10,2),
    reasoning TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 🚨 Priority 3: AI Orchestrator (The "Commissioner")

**Concept**: Meta-AI that doesn't make predictions but monitors experts and suggests improvements

#### Responsibilities

1. **Data Quality Monitor**
   - Validates incoming data from all sources
   - Flags suspicious patterns or data anomalies
   - Ensures experts have access to latest information

2. **Model Performance Analyst**
   - Tracks which experts are improving/declining
   - Identifies when expert strategies become stale
   - Suggests parameter adjustments (e.g., "The Gambler needs lower risk tolerance")

3. **Strategy Recommender**
   - Analyzes successful prediction patterns
   - Suggests new expert personalities needed
   - Recommends when to retire underperforming experts

4. **Data Access Controller**
   - Determines which data sources each expert gets
   - Some experts get real-time news, others don't (personality-based)
   - Controls information asymmetry for realism

#### Implementation

```python
# src/ml/orchestrator/meta_coordinator.py

class MetaOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_quality_checker = DataQualityChecker()
        self.performance_analyzer = PerformanceAnalyzer()
        self.strategy_recommender = StrategyRecommender()

    async def hourly_review(self):
        """Run every hour to monitor system health"""
        # Check data freshness
        stale_sources = await self.data_quality_checker.check_data_age()

        # Analyze expert performance trends
        performance_alerts = await self.performance_analyzer.detect_anomalies()

        # Suggest improvements
        recommendations = await self.strategy_recommender.generate_recommendations()

        # Log to orchestrator_logs table
        await self.log_review(stale_sources, performance_alerts, recommendations)

    async def pre_game_data_distribution(self, game_id):
        """Before each game, decide what data each expert gets"""
        game_data = await self.gather_game_data(game_id)

        for expert in self.experts:
            # Data-driven experts get everything
            if expert.personality == 'data_driven':
                expert_data = game_data
            # Gut-feel experts get limited data
            elif expert.personality == 'intuition':
                expert_data = self.filter_to_basics(game_data)
            # Contrarian experts get public sentiment
            elif expert.personality == 'contrarian':
                expert_data = {**game_data, 'public_sentiment': True}

            await expert.receive_data(expert_data)
```

**Database Tables:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE orchestrator_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    log_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    log_type VARCHAR(50), -- data_quality/performance_alert/recommendation
    severity VARCHAR(20), -- info/warning/critical
    message TEXT,
    affected_experts TEXT[],
    action_taken TEXT,
    metadata JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE orchestrator_recommendations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    recommendation_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    recommendation_type VARCHAR(50),
    target_expert_id VARCHAR(50),
    suggested_action TEXT,
    reasoning TEXT,
    implemented BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    implemented_at TIMESTAMP,
    outcome TEXT
);
```

💰 The Gambler just bet $2,400 on Chiefs -2.5!
   "I'm all in on this one - KC road dominance is REAL"
   Risk Level: EXTREME 🔴

📊 The Analyst placed conservative $600 bet on Under 47.5
   "Statistical models show defensive game, 73% confidence"
   Risk Level: LOW 🟢

😈 The Rebel FADING public - $1,800 on Eagles +2.5!
   "81% of public on Chiefs? Time to fade the noise"

**3. Prediction Battles** ⚔️

```
Show head-to-head when experts disagree:

[EPIC BATTLE: Chiefs @ Bills]

📊 The Analyst          vs          🎲 The Gambler
   Chiefs -2.5                         Bills +2.5
   $850 bet (9%)                       $2,400 bet (38%)
   78% confidence                      92% confidence

   Reasoning:                          Reasoning:
   • Statistical edge                  • Home underdog value
   • 5-year road data                  • Playoff atmosphere
   • Weather neutral                   • Public on Chiefs

   Historical H2H:                     Risk Assessment:
   Analyst: 23-15 vs Gambler          🔴 EXTREME RISK
   Last 5: 3-2 advantage              If wrong: Down to $3,900
                                      If right: Up to $8,700

[VOTE FOR WINNER] 👍 Analyst | 👍 Gambler
```

**4. Memory Lane** 🧠

```
Show when experts recall past games:

💭 The Scholar is thinking...

"This reminds me of Week 3, 2023 - similar weather, same spread.
 I picked the underdog that time and was WRONG. Lost $1,200.

 Adjusting confidence DOWN from 82% → 68%
 Reducing bet size from $1,200 → $700

 Lesson learned: Rainy games in Buffalo are unpredictable"

When an expert goes bust:

🚨 ELIMINATION ALERT 🚨

💀 The Chaos has been ELIMINATED!

Final Bet: $2,100 on Titans +14 (ALL IN)
Result: Titans lose by 21
Final Bankroll: $0

Season Stats:
• Started: $10,000
• Bets Placed: 89
• Win Rate: 38%
• Best Bet: +$3,200 (Week 2 upset)

## 🚧 Known Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Vegas Odds API Rate Limits

**Problem**: Free tier only allows 500 requests/day
**Solution**: Cache odds, update every 30 min instead of real-time, prioritize games within 48 hours

### Challenge 2: Expert Elimination Cascade

**Problem**: If 3+ experts eliminated early, council becomes unstable
**Solution**: Have "reserve experts" ready to activate, minimum 10 active experts required

### Challenge 3: Fake Betting vs Real Consequences

**Problem**: Users might not care about virtual bankrolls
**Solution**: Add leaderboard, seasonal rewards (badges), expert retirement ceremonies

### Challenge 4: Data Source Reliability

**Problem**: APIs go down, data gets stale
**Solution**: Orchestrator monitoring + fallback sources + "data confidence" scoring

### Challenge 5: Overfitting to Recent Performance

**Problem**: 4-week evaluation window might cause volatility
**Solution**: Add minimum sample size (10 predictions), smooth recent performance with exponential moving average

## 🔗 Key Integration Points

### Frontend → Backend

```typescript
// src/hooks/useExpertBankrolls.ts
export const useExpertBankrolls = () => {
  return useQuery(['expert-bankrolls'], async () => {
    const { data } = await supabase
      .from('expert_virtual_bankrolls')
      .select('*')
      .order('current_balance', { ascending: false })
    return data
  })
}

// src/hooks/useLiveBettingFeed.ts
export const useLiveBettingFeed = (gameId: string) => {
  return useQuery(['betting-feed', gameId], async () => {
    const { data } = await supabase
      .from('expert_virtual_bets')
      .select(`
        *,
        expert:expert_models(name, emoji, archetype)
      `)
      .eq('game_id', gameId)
      .eq('result', 'pending')
      .order('bet_placed_at', { ascending: false })
    return data
  })
}
```

### Backend → Data Sources

```python
# src/services/data_coordinator.py
class DataCoordinator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weather = WeatherIngestionService()
        self.news = NewsIngestionService()
        self.social = SocialSentimentService()
        self.odds = VegasOddsService()
        self.stats = AdvancedStatsService()

    async def gather_game_data(self, game_id: str):
        """Gather all available data for a game"""
        return {
            'weather': await self.weather.get_game_weather(game_id),
            'injuries': await self.news.get_injury_report(game_id),
            'sentiment': await self.social.get_public_sentiment(game_id),
            'odds': await self.odds.get_current_lines(game_id),
            'stats': await self.stats.get_matchup_stats(game_id)
        }
```

---

## 📝 Next Session TODO

**Immediate priorities for new session:**

1. **Create data ingestion services** (Start with weather + Vegas odds)
2. **Implement bet tracking system** (expert_virtual_bets table + logic)
3. **Remove mock data from ConfidencePoolPage** (connect to real DB)
4. **Build Live Betting Feed component** (show experts placing real bets)
5. **Add bankroll display to expert cards** (current balance + change)

**Questions to resolve:**

- Which Vegas odds API to use? (The Odds API recommended - has free tier)
- Should orchestrator be rule-based or ML-powered? (Start rule-based, evolve to ML)
- Elimination replacement policy? (Auto-activate reserve, or mid-season draft?)
- How to handle experts that refuse to bet? (Penalty system, confidence floor)

## 🎬 The Vision

**End Goal**: Users open the app and see:

- 5 AI experts with virtual money on the line arguing about predictions
- Real data flowing in (weather alerts, injury news, line movements)
- Experts adjusting their bets based on new information
- Drama when an expert goes all-in or faces elimination
- Learning/memory system showing experts getting smarter over time
- Orchestrator providing meta-commentary on expert performance

This isn't just "here's what AI predicts" - it's "watch AI experts compete with real stakes, using real data, learning from real mistakes."

**The magic**: Users trust predictions more because experts have "skin in the game" (virtual bankroll). An expert saying 95% confidence AND betting 20% of bankroll is way more believable than just a percentage.
