# üèà NFL Expert System - Predictions vs Actual Results
## LAC @ LV - Monday Night Football (Sept 16, 2025)

---

## ‚úÖ SYSTEM UPDATES COMPLETED

### 1. Fixed Quarter Predictions
- **Issue**: All experts had identical quarter scores
- **Solution**: Generated unique predictions based on expert personality traits
  - Conservative experts: Lower scoring quarters (0-14 points)
  - High-variance experts: Higher scoring quarters with +7-14 bonus points
  - Analytical experts: Moderate Q2 scoring (0-17 points)
  - Clutch specialists: Higher Q4 scoring (3-17 points)

### 2. Clarified Quarter Score Format
- **Confirmed**: Quarter scores show points scored IN that quarter only
- **NOT cumulative** - this matches how quarter betting works online
- Example: Q1: 7-3, Q2: 10-7 means 10 points scored in Q2, not 17 total
