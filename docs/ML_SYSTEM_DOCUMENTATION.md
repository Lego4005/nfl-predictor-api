## Advanced Features

### EPA (Expected Points Added)
```python
# Field position-based expected points
epa_values = {
    down: {yard_line: base_epa * position_factor}
    for down in range(1, 5)
    for yard_line in range(1, 101)
}

# Adjustments for play outcomes
if touchdown: epa = 7.0 - base_epa
elif turnover: epa = -base_epa - 1.0
else: epa = new_epa - base_epa
```

### Success Rate Calculation
```python
success_thresholds = {
    1: 0.5,  # 50% of yards needed on 1st down
    2: 0.7,  # 70% of yards needed on 2nd down
    3: 1.0,  # 100% of yards needed on 3rd/4th down
}

success = (yards_gained >= yards_to_go * threshold) or touchdown or first_down
```

### DVOA-Style Metrics
```python
# Offensive efficiency
offensive_dvoa = (epa_per_play * 0.6) + (success_rate * 0.4)

# Defensive efficiency (inverse of opponent performance)
defensive_dvoa = -((opponent_epa_per_play * 0.6) + (opponent_success_rate * 0.4))
```

## Integration with Expert System

### ML-Enhanced Predictions
The system integrates ML models with expert reasoning:

```python
# Get ML predictions
ml_predictions = self._get_ml_predictions(game, historical_data)

# Add ML reasoning factor
if ml_predictions:
    scoring_factors.append(ReasoningFactor(
        factor="ml_model_prediction",
        value=f"ML Win Prob: {ml_predictions['home_win_probability']:.3f}",
        weight=self.personality.get('ml_weight', 0.8),
        confidence=ml_predictions['confidence'],
        source="ensemble_ml_models"
    ))

# Combine ML with expert adjustments
if ml_predictions:
    base_score = ml_predictions['predicted_total'] * win_probability
    expert_adjustments = self._calculate_factor_adjustment(scoring_factors)
    final_score = base_score + expert_adjustments
```

print(f"Confidence: {prediction['confidence']:.3f}")
```

### Expert Integration

    expert_id="analytics_expert",
    name="Analytics Expert",
    personality={'ml_weight': 0.8, 'offensive_weight': 0.7},
    models_dir='/path/to/models'
)

# Generate comprehensive predictions
prediction = expert.predict_comprehensive(game_data, historical_data)

# Check ML integration status
status = expert.get_ml_model_status()
print(f"ML Models Loaded: {status['models_loaded']}")
```

## Model Interpretability

### Feature Importance
```python
# Get feature importance from ensemble
insights = ensemble.get_model_insights()

print("Top Game Winner Features:")
for _, row in insights['game_winner_features'].head(10).iterrows():
    print(f"  {row['feature']}: {row['importance']:.4f}")
```

### Confidence Analysis
```python
# Analyze prediction confidence
confidence_metrics = calibrator.calculate_comprehensive_confidence(
    predictions={'model_1': probs_1, 'model_2': probs_2},
    model_weights={'model_1': 0.6, 'model_2': 0.4}
)

print(f"Overall Confidence: {confidence_metrics['confidence_score']:.3f}")

## API Integration

The ML system integrates seamlessly with the existing NFL prediction API:

```python
# In prediction_service.py
from src.ml.comprehensive_intelligent_predictor import IntelligentExpertPredictor

# Initialize experts with ML capabilities
experts = [
    IntelligentExpertPredictor("ml_expert", "ML Expert", ml_personality),
    # ... other experts
]

# Generate predictions with ML enhancement
for expert in experts:
    prediction = expert.predict_comprehensive(game, historical_data)
    # ML predictions automatically integrated into reasoning chains
```

This comprehensive ML system provides state-of-the-art NFL prediction capabilities while maintaining the interpretability and reasoning transparency of the expert system.
