## Technical Architecture

### Core Files
- `autonomous_expert_system.py` - Main orchestrator
- `personality_driven_experts.py` - 15 expert implementations
- `expert_memory_service.py` - Supabase persistence layer

### Database Tables (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- `personality_experts` - Expert profiles and current weights
- `expert_memory` - Historical predictions with 768-dim embeddings
- `expert_evolution` - Algorithm changes over time
- `expert_learning_queue` - Async learning pipeline
- `expert_tool_access` - External data gathering log
- `expert_peer_learning` - Cross-expert knowledge sharing

### Key Features

#### 1. Autonomous Learning
- Each expert adjusts weights based on performance
- Learning rate varies by personality (0.04 - 0.16)
- Historical pattern matching via pgvector similarity search

#### 2. Peer Learning
- Successful predictions shared across experts
- No methodology sharing (maintains personality integrity)
- Consensus followers learn from high-agreement predictions
- Contrarians learn opposite lessons from failures

#### 3. Tool Access
- All experts can access: news, weather, injuries, betting lines
- Equal information access ensures fair competition
- Tool usage logged for analysis

#### 4. Mathematical Consistency
- 25 prediction sub-components maintained
- Proper confidence intervals (0.0 - 1.0)
- No impossible predictions
- Cascade mathematical consistency

## API Endpoints

### Primary Endpoints
- `GET /v1/expert-predictions/{home_team}/{away_team}` - Get all 15 expert predictions
- `GET /v1/expert-battle-card/{game_id}` - Compare expert performance
- `POST /v1/expert-learning/{game_id}` - Trigger learning from results

### Response Structure
```json

}
```

## Advantages Over Domain-Based System

1. **Fair Competition**: No structural advantages based on game conditions
2. **Personality Diversity**: 15 distinct decision-making approaches
3. **Autonomous Evolution**: Self-improving through experience
4. **Interpretability**: Personality traits explain decisions
5. **Scalability**: Can add new personalities without breaking fairness

## Future Enhancements

- Dynamic personality trait adjustment based on season-long performance
- Personality clustering for meta-ensemble predictions
- Adversarial personality creation (learns to beat other experts)
- Emotional state modeling based on recent performance

## Environment Variables

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Without these, the system runs in offline mode (no persistent memory or learning).

## Migration Complete âœ…

The old domain-biased system has been:
- Archived in `/src/ml/deprecated/`
- Documented in `/docs/MIGRATION_NOTES.md`
- Replaced with personality-driven experts
- Database tables prepared for removal (migration 009)

The personality-driven system is now the sole expert infrastructure.
