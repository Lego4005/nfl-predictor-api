# Task 5.4 - 2024 Baselines A/B Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive baseline model testing and intelligent model switching system for the Expert Council Betting System. This system provides A/B testing capabilities to compare expert predictions against baseline models and automatically route underperforming experts to simpler models until performance improves.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Baseline Models Service (`src/services/baseline_models_service.py`)

Implemented four distinct baseline models for comparison:

#### Coin-Flip Model
- **Purpose**: Random 50/50 predictions with controlled noise
- **Configuration**: Confidence range (0.45-0.55), stake range (1-3)
- **Use Case**: Baseline for measuring if experts perform better than random chance

#### Market-Only Model
- **Purpose**: Predictions based purely on market odds
- **Configuration**: 10% confidence boost, 1.5x stake multiplier
- **Use Case**: Test if experts add value beyond market consensus

#### One-Shot Model
- **Purpose**: Single LLM call without memory or context
- **Configuration**: DeepSeek model, 2000 tokens, 0.3 temperature
- **Use Case**: Fallback for experts with schema validation issues

#### Deliberate Model
- **Purpose**: Rule-based heuristic predictions
- **Configuration**: 55% home advantage, 60% favorite bias, 52% over bias
- **Use Case**: Fast, deterministic predictions for high-latency scenarios

### 2. Model Switching Service (`src/services/model_switching_service.py`)

Implemented intelligent model switching with multiple decision factors:

#### Eligibility Gates
- **JSON Validity**: ≥98.5% schema compliance required
- **Latency SLO**: ≤6 second response time limit
- **Minimum Predictions**: ≥10 predictions for statistical significance

#### Performance Degradation Detection
- **Brier Score**: 5% increase triggers review
- **ROI Degradation**: 10% decrease triggers review
- **Consecutive Failures**: 3 poor performances trigger switch

#### Multi-Armed Bandit Exploration
- **Exploration Rate**: 15% minimum with 95% decay over time
- **Confidence Threshold**: 80% confidence required for switches
- **Dwell Time**: 3-10 games minimum before re-evaluation

#### Model Selection Logic
- Schema failures → One-shot model
- Poor ROI (< -15%) → Market-only model
- High latency (> 8s) → Deliberate model
- Default fallback → One-shot model

### 3. API Endpoints (`src/api/baseline_testing_endpoints.py`)

Comprehensive REST API with 8 endpoints:

#### Core Functionality
- `POST /api/baseline-testing/compare` - Run comprehensive baseline comparisons
- `POST /api/baseline-testing/baseline/{type}/predict` - Generate specific baseline predictions
- `GET /api/baseline-testing/switching/recommendations` - Get switching recommendations
- `POST /api/baseline-testing/switching/implement` - Execute model switches

#### Analytics & Management
- `GET /api/baseline-testing/switching/analytics` - Performance analytics
- `POST /api/baseline-testing/performance/update` - Update performance metrics
- `GET /api/baseline-testing/models/available` - List available models
- `GET /api/baseline-testing/health` - Health check endpoint

### 4. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/040_baseline_testing_schema.sql`)

Comprehensive schema with 8 tables for tracking:

#### Core Tables
- `model_performance_metrics` - Performance tracking (Brier/MAE/ROI/accuracy)
- `expert_model_assignments` - Current model assignments per expert
- `model_switching_history` - Complete switching audit trail
- `baseline_prediction_results` - Baseline model prediction storage

#### Analytics Tables
- `baseline_comparison_results` - Comparison study results
- `model_eligibility_log` - Eligibility gate check history
- `performance_degradation_alerts` - Automated degradation detection

#### Database Functions
- `get_current_model_assignment()` - Get active model for expert
- `check_model_eligibility()` - Validate eligibility gates
- `update_model_performance()` - Update metrics with eligibility scoring

### 5. Performance Metrics & Comparison

#### Comparison Metrics
- **Brier Score**: Probabilistic accuracy for binary/enum predictions
- **MAE Score**: Mean absolute error for numeric predictions
- **ROI**: Return on investment for betting performance
- **Accuracy**: Simple correctness percentage
- **Calibration Error**: Confidence vs actual accuracy alignment

#### Eligibility Scoring Formula
```
Score = 0.35 × (1 - Brier/0.5) + 0.35 × (1 - MAE/10.0) + 0.20 × ((ROI + 0.2)/0.4) + 0.10 × JSON_Validity
```

## Key Features

### Intelligent Routing
- Automatically routes underperforming experts to appropriate baseline models
- Considers specific failure modes (schema, latency, accuracy)
- Maintains expert autonomy while providing fallback options

### A/B Testing Framework
- Compare any combination of experts vs baseline models
- Statistical significance testing with minimum prediction thresholds
- Comprehensive performance comparison across multiple metrics

### Adaptive Learning
- Multi-armed bandit exploration prevents local optima
