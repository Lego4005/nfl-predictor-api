## Important: Daily Limits for Free Models

**Free models have daily usage limits in addition to per-minute rate limits:**
- **Rate Limit:** 20 requests/minute for all free models
- **Daily Limits:** Vary by model (exact limits not always published)

### **Processing Strategy for 3,840 Total Requests:**

**Option 1: Single Day Processing**
- **Time Required:** 3,840 requests √∑ 20 per minute = 192 minutes = **3.2 hours minimum**
- **Risk:** May hit daily limits partway through
- **Mitigation:** Start early in the day, monitor for rate limit errors

**Option 2: Multi-Day Processing**
- **Day 1:** Process ~1,000-1,500 requests (games 1-100)
- **Day 2:** Process remaining games
- **Advantage:** Avoids daily limits
- **Time:** 2-3 days total

**Option 3: Paid Model for Reliability**
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** No daily limits, higher rate limits
- **Cost:** $20-40 for complete season
- **Time:** 3-4 hours guaranteed completion

## Updated Recommendation

Given the daily limits concern:

### **For Reliable Single-Day Processing:**
- **Use:** `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` (paid)
- **Cost:** $20-40
- **Guarantee:** Will complete in 3-4 hours

### **For Free Processing (Risk of Multi-Day):**
- **Use:** `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free` (current default)
- **Cost:** FREE
- **Risk:** May need to split across 2 days if daily limits hit

### **Hybrid Approach:**
- **Start with:** DeepSeek free model
- **If daily limits hit:** Switch to Claude 3.5 Sonnet for remainder
- **Cost:** $0-30 depending on where limits hit

**What's your preference given the daily limits consideration?**
