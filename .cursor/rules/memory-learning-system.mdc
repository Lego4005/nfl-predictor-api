# memory-learning-system

## Episodic Memory Framework 
Importance Score: 95/100

Path: src/ml/memory_enabled_expert_service.py

Core memory system for NFL predictions using:
- Four-dimensional memory vectors:
  1. Reasoning chain (pre-game analysis)
  2. Learning reflection (post-game insights)  
  3. Context (environmental factors)
  4. Market sentiment (betting dynamics)
- Temporal decay calculations:
  - Weather patterns: 900 days
  - Market signals: 60 days
  - Coach history: 240 days 
  - Team momentum: 30 days
  - Venue effects: 730 days

## Memory Retrieval Engine
Importance Score: 90/100

Path: src/ml/episodic_retrieval/retrieval_engine.py

Custom retrieval scoring:
```python
final_score = (0.70 × similarity_score) + (0.30 × 0.5^(days_old / expert_half_life))
```

Memory quality modulation:
- Vividness: 30%
- Temporal relevance: 20%  
- Retrieval frequency: 20%
- Quality metrics: 30%

## Learning Feedback Loop
Importance Score: 85/100

Path: src/ml/learning/feedback_system.py

Implements:
- Belief revision based on prediction outcomes
- Confidence calibration through historical accuracy
- Expert specialization detection
- Performance trend analysis
- Learning rate adjustment:
  ```python
  adjusted_learning = base_rate × 0.5^(days_since_outcome / expert_half_life)
  ```

## Memory Formation 
Importance Score: 80/100

Path: src/ml/memory/formation_engine.py

Creates structured memories containing:
- Pre-game analysis chain
- Key factor weightings
- Confidence metrics  
- Market sentiment analysis
- Environmental conditions
- Post-game reflection
- Learning insights
