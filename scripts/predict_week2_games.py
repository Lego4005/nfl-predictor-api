2. SHARP BETTOR: Line movement vs public betting %
   ‚Üí Looks at: If line moves opposite to public money = sharp action

3. WEATHER WIZARD: Environmental impact calculations
   ‚Üí Looks at: Wind speed, precipitation, dome/outdoor

4. QB WHISPERER: QB rating differentials
   ‚Üí Looks at: Passer rating, QB vs specific defense history

5. INJURY ANALYST: Health advantage scoring
   ‚Üí Looks at: Key injuries √ó position importance (QB=35%, RB=15%)

6. HOME FIELD HAWK: Travel + timezone + crowd factors
   ‚Üí Always picks home team, confidence varies by factors

7. ROAD WARRIOR: Contrarian road team specialist
   ‚Üí Looks for road teams with better away record than home's home record
