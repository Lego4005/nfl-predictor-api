CURRENT STATE (Week 2):
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Database tables with vector columns created
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ 15 experts making predictions with unique algorithms
‚Ä¢ ‚è≥ No historical data yet (season just started)

HOW PGVECTOR WILL WORK:

1Ô∏è‚É£ WEEKS 1-4: Building History
   - Store each expert's predictions as 384-dim vectors
   - Capture context (weather, injuries, spreads) as vectors
   - Record actual results

2Ô∏è‚É£ WEEKS 5-8: Pattern Emergence
   - Start finding similar historical situations
   - "This looks like Week 3 Chiefs vs Bills" (85% similarity)
   - Experts begin learning from past mistakes

3Ô∏è‚É£ WEEKS 9+: Full Intelligence
   - Expert fingerprints emerge (success vs failure vectors)
   - Cross-expert learning ("Sharp Bettor's contrarian strategy works in primetime")
   - Situation-specific expert selection

EXAMPLE VECTOR SEARCH (After Week 8):
```sql
-- Find games similar to tonight's matchup
SELECT game_id, similarity(context_embedding, [tonight's vector])
FROM expert_predictions_comprehensive
WHERE similarity > 0.85
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

This finds: "In 3 similar games, Weather Wizard was 3-0 but Sharp Bettor was 1-2"
So we'd weight Weather Wizard higher for this specific situation!
