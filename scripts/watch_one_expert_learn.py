Watch ONE Expert Learn Over Time

Follows a single expert through multiple weeks to see how they learn:
- ONE expert: conservative_analyzer (the only one working without odds)
- ALL games from Weeks 1-4 (64 games)
- Shows their reasoning, prediction, result for each game
- Track improvement over time
