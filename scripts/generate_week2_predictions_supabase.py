CURRENT (Week 2 - Using Supabase):
✅ 272 historical games in PostgreSQL database
✅ Team performance metrics calculated from real data
✅ Similar game matching using traditional algorithms
✅ Each expert has access to 2 years of history
⏳ No expert-specific historical accuracy yet

WEEK 5+ (With More Data):
🎯 Expert fingerprinting: "Sharp Bettor is 12-3 when line moves 2+ points"
🎯 Situation matching: "In 5 similar weather conditions, Under hit 4 times"
🎯 Cross-expert learning: "When top 3 agree, accuracy jumps to 78%"
🎯 pgvector similarity: 384-dimensional embeddings for pattern matching

HOW PGVECTOR IMPROVES PREDICTIONS:
1. Stores each prediction as a 384-dim vector
2. Finds similar historical situations with cosine similarity
3. Learns which experts excel in which situations
4. Adjusts confidence based on historical performance
