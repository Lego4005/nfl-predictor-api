## Component 1: Expert Configuration Manager

### Purpose
Defines the personality profiles and parameter sheets for fifteen distinct expert agents, each with unique temporal characteristics and analytical focus areas.

### Key Features

#### Expert Personalities
- **15 Unique Expert Types**: From Conservative Analyzer to Momentum Tracker
- **Temporal Spectrum**: Half-lives ranging from 45 days (Momentum Tracker) to 730 days (Weather Specialist)
- **Analytical Focus Weights**: Each expert has 10+ analytical factors with weights 0-1

#### Temporal Parameters
```python
# Example: Weather Specialist vs Momentum Tracker
Weather Specialist:
  temporal_half_life_days: 730    # Physics doesn't change
  similarity_weight: 0.85         # Pattern similarity matters most
  temporal_weight: 0.15           # Recency matters least

Momentum Tracker:
  temporal_half_life_days: 45     # Only recent matters
  similarity_weight: 0.40         # Patterns less important
  temporal_weight: 0.60           # Recency is everything
```

#### Analytical Focus Examples
```python
Weather Specialist:
  'weather_temperature': 0.95
  'wind_speed_direction': 0.95
  'precipitation_conditions': 0.9
  'market_dynamics': 0.2          # Barely cares about markets

Contrarian Expert:
  'public_betting_bias': 0.95
  'contrarian_value_spots': 0.95
  'crowd_psychology_indicators': 0.85
  'weather_conditions': 0.5       # Weather less important
```

#### Seasonal Adjustment
- **Early Season (Weeks 1-4)**: Extend half-lives by 25-50% due to data scarcity
- **Late Season (Weeks 13+)**: Reduce half-lives by 10-25% as current data becomes rich
- **Mid Season**: Standard half-life parameters

### Implementation
- **File**: `src/training/expert_configuration.py`
- **Classes**: `ExpertType`, `ExpertConfiguration`, `ExpertConfigurationManager`
- **Validation**: Ensures weights sum to 1.0, analytical focus weights are valid

---

## Component 2: Temporal Decay Calculator

### Purpose
Implements the exponential decay formula that determines how much weight to give memories of different ages based on expert-specific temporal parameters.

### Mathematical Foundation

#### Core Formula
```
decay_score = 0.5^(age_days / half_life_days)
```

#### Weighted Combination
```
final_score = (similarity_weight × similarity_score) + (temporal_weight × decay_score)
```

### Expert Behavior Examples

For a memory that's 80% similar to current game:

| Expert Type | 7 Days | 30 Days | 90 Days | 180 Days | 365 Days |
|-------------|--------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Momentum Tracker | 0.859 | 0.698 | 0.470 | 0.358 | 0.285 |
| Market Reader | 0.825 | 0.750 | 0.600 | 0.500 | 0.400 |
| Conservative | 0.838 | 0.831 | 0.814 | 0.792 | 0.750 |
| Weather Specialist | 0.829 | 0.826 | 0.818 | 0.806 | 0.785 |

### Key Insights
- **Momentum Tracker**: Rapid decay - 7-day memory scores 0.859, 180-day memory only 0.358
- **Weather Specialist**: Stable scores - 7-day memory 0.829, 365-day memory still 0.785
- **Conservative Analyzer**: Values proven patterns - maintains high scores across all ages
- **Market Reader**: Balanced approach - moderate decay reflecting market dynamics

### Validation Features
- **Half-life Property**: Score = 0.5 at exactly half-life age
- **Monotonic Decrease**: Older memories always score lower
- **Edge Case Handling**: Age 0 = 1.0, negative ages = 1.0, extreme ages approach 0

### Implementation
- **File**: `src/training/temporal_decay_calculator.py`
- **Classes**: `DecayScore`, `TemporalDecayCalculator`
- **Testing**: Validates exponential decay formula with expert configurations

### Implementation
- **File**: `src/training/memory_retrieval_system.py`
- **Classes**: `GameMemory`, `RetrievedMemory`, `MemoryRetrievalResult`, `MemoryRetrievalSystem`
- **Storage**: Mock in-memory storage (production would use vector database)

---

## Component 4: Prediction Generator

### Purpose
Takes expert configurations, game data, and retrieved memories to produce predictions with human-readable reasoning chains.

### Prediction Types
1. **Winner Predictions**: Team selection with win probability and confidence
2. **Spread Predictions**: Point spread adjustment with confidence level
3. **Total Predictions**: Over/under adjustment with confidence level

### Prediction Generation Process

#### 1. Game Context Analysis
- Apply expert's analytical focus weights to game factors
- Generate weighted insights based on expert personality
- Identify key observations and concern areas

#### 2. Memory Integration
- Extract patterns from retrieved memories
- Weight historical outcomes by memory scores
- Incorporate learning lessons from past mistakes

#### 3. Prediction Calculation

**Winner Prediction**:
```python
# Start with base home field advantage
home_win_prob = 0.55

# Adjust based on analytical insights
for factor, insight in analytical_insights:
    if insight.impact == 'home':
        home_win_prob += 0.05 * insight.weight
    elif insight.impact == 'away':
        home_win_prob -= 0.05 * insight.weight

# Adjust based on memory patterns
for pattern in memory_insights:
    if 'home' in pattern.content:
        home_win_prob += 0.03 * pattern.weight
```

**Total Prediction**:
```python
# Start with current market total
predicted_total = current_total

# Weather heavily impacts totals
if temp <= 32:
    total_adjustment -= 3.0  # Cold reduces scoring
if wind >= 15:
    total_adjustment -= 2.0  # Wind reduces passing

# Memory-based adjustments
for outcome in historical_outcomes:
    historical_total = outcome.total
    total_adjustment += (historical_total - current_total) * 0.15 * weight
```

#### 4. Reasoning Chain Generation
- Expert introduction and methodology
- Key factors being considered
- Historical memory insights
- Concerns and adjustments
- Final prediction rationale

### Example Prediction Output

**Weather Specialist for KC vs DEN (28°F, 18 mph wind)**:

```
Winner Prediction: KC (58.6%) - Confidence: 17.2%
Total Prediction: 36.0 - Confidence: 73.3%

Reasoning:
  As The Meteorologist, I analyze this total prediction:
  Key factors I'm considering:
    • Freezing temperature (28°F) favors ground game
    • High winds (18 mph) will impact passing game
  Based on similar historical situations:
    • Cold weather games historically favor teams with strong running attacks (45 days ago)
    • Heavy public betting creates contrarian value in primetime games (60 days ago)

Key Factors: Weather Temperature, Wind Speed Direction, Historical Pattern Recognition
Primary Focus: Weather Temperature, Wind Speed Direction, Precipitation Conditions
```

### Expert Personality Differences

**Weather Specialist**:
- Total: 36.0 (heavy weather impact)
- High confidence on total (73.3%) due to weather expertise
- Low confidence on winner (17.2%) - weather affects scoring more than outcomes

**Contrarian Expert**:
- Total: 38.0 (moderate weather consideration)
- Focuses on public betting patterns and fade opportunities
- Lower overall confidence due to contrarian nature

**Momentum Tracker**:
- Total: 37.5 (influenced by team streaks)
- Higher winner confidence (18.1%) due to "hot 3-game win streak"
- Emphasizes recent performance trends

### Implementation
- **File**: `src/training/prediction_generator.py`
- **Classes**: `PredictionType`, `GamePrediction`, `PredictionGenerator`
- **Output**: Structured predictions with reasoning chains and confidence levels
